## Routes

- `/password-reset` - Request password reset (email form)
- `/password-reset?token=xxx` - Reset password (password form)

## User Flows

### Flow 1: Request Password Reset
1. User navigates to `/password-reset`
2. Enters email address
3. Clicks "Send Reset Link"
4. Sees success confirmation
5. Can resend email after 60 seconds if needed
6. Returns to login or waits for email

### Flow 2: Reset Password
1. User clicks link in email (with token)
2. Arrives at `/password-reset?token=xxx`
3. Enters new password (with strength indicator)
4. Confirms new password
5. Clicks "Reset Password"
6. Sees success confirmation
7. Auto-redirected to login after 3 seconds

### Flow 3: Error Handling
1. Invalid email format → Inline validation error
2. Weak password → Strength indicator shows "Weak"
3. Passwords don't match → Inline error on confirm field
4. Expired token → Toast error message
5. Network error → Toast error with retry option
