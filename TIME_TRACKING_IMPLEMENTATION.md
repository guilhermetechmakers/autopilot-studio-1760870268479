  - Red: `#F47A7A` (Rejected)
  - Purple: `#B98CF9` (Timer)

### Typography
- Font family: Inter (modern sans-serif)
- Bold headings, regular body, medium labels
- Clear hierarchy with size and weight variations

### Components
- Rounded corners: 12-16px radius
- Soft shadows for elevation
- Hover states with subtle transitions
- Generous padding: 20-28px
- High contrast text colors

### Interactions
- Button hover: Slight lift with shadow
- Card hover: Background lightening
- Smooth transitions: 200-300ms
- Loading states with skeleton loaders
- Toast notifications for feedback

## Technical Implementation

### Technologies Used
- **React 18.3.1**: Component architecture
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe code
- **Tailwind CSS v3**: Styling system
- **Shadcn/ui**: UI component library
- **date-fns**: Date manipulation
- **Sonner**: Toast notifications
- **React Router 6.30.1**: Navigation

### Best Practices
- Functional components with hooks
- TypeScript interfaces for all data structures
- Proper error handling with try-catch
- Optimistic UI updates
- Offline-first approach
- localStorage for persistence
- Debounced API calls (ready for implementation)
- Proper cleanup in useEffect hooks
