## API Integration

### Mock API (Current)
- All data stored in memory
- Simulates network delays
- Returns realistic mock data
- Ready for backend integration

### Backend Integration Points
```typescript
// Replace mock implementations in src/api/intake.ts with real API calls

// Example:
export const intakeApi = {
  getAll: async () => {
    const response = await fetch('/api/intakes');
    return response.json();
  },
  
  create: async (input) => {
    const response = await fetch('/api/intakes', {
      method: 'POST',
      body: JSON.stringify(input),
    });
    return response.json();
  },
  
  // ... other methods
};
```

### Required Backend Endpoints
- `GET /api/intakes` - List all intakes
- `GET /api/intakes/:id` - Get intake by ID
- `POST /api/intakes` - Create new intake
- `PATCH /api/intakes/:id` - Update intake
- `POST /api/intakes/:id/qualify` - Qualify intake
- `POST /api/intakes/:id/ai-assist` - Get AI assistance
- `POST /api/intakes/:id/generate-proposal` - Generate proposal
- `POST /api/intakes/:id/schedule-discovery` - Schedule discovery call
- `POST /api/intakes/:id/upload` - Upload file
- `DELETE /api/intakes/:id` - Delete intake

## AI Integration

### Current Implementation
Mock AI responses with realistic suggestions and questions.

### Production AI Integration
Replace mock AI in `src/api/intake.ts`:

```typescript
// Example with OpenAI
import OpenAI from 'openai';

const openai = new OpenAI({ apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY });

async function getAISuggestions(field: string, context: Partial<IntakeForm>) {
  const prompt = `Based on this project context: ${JSON.stringify(context)}
  Suggest 3 ${field} that would be appropriate for this project.`;
  
  const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
    model: 'gpt-4',
    messages: [{ role: 'user', content: prompt }],
  });
  
  return parseAIResponse(response);
}
```

- [ ] Test responsive design (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- [ ] Test keyboard navigation
- [ ] Test with screen reader

### Edge Cases
- [ ] Submit with minimal data
- [ ] Submit with maximum data
- [ ] Navigate away and return (autosave)
- [ ] Network error handling
- [ ] AI timeout handling
- [ ] Invalid email format
- [ ] Invalid date ranges

## Future Enhancements

### Phase 2

## Known Limitations

1. **File Upload**: UI ready but backend integration needed
2. **Calendar Integration**: Placeholder URL for discovery calls
3. **Email Notifications**: Not implemented yet
4. **Real-time Collaboration**: Single user only
5. **Offline Support**: Requires internet connection

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Autosave not working
**Solution**: Check that intake ID exists (created after step 1)

### Issue: AI suggestions not appearing
**Solution**: Ensure project description is filled in step 2

### Issue: Qualification score not calculating
**Solution**: Complete all required fields before qualifying

### Issue: Navigation not working
**Solution**: Check that required fields are filled for current step
