# Project Cursor Rules

This file contains project-specific development rules and guidelines.
These rules will be automatically applied when working in this project with Cursor.

## Design Pattern: ---

## Visual Style

### Color Palette:
- Primary background: Deep charcoal (#23272F) for main UI, with slightly darker sidebar (#1A1D23)
- Accent colors: Soft yellow (#FFDF6E), muted green (#72D47A), pale blue (#60B4F7), soft red (#F47A7A), and light purple (#B98CF9) for tags, status, and avatars
- Card backgrounds: Medium dark gray (#2C313A), with subtle variations for elevation
- Text colors: High-contrast white (#FFFFFF) for headings, light gray (#B0B6C3) for secondary text, muted gray (#818899) for placeholders and hints
- Border and divider: Subtle, semi-transparent gray (#353A43)
- Interaction highlights: Accent colors used sparingly for status indicators, toggles, and active items
- No gradients; flat, solid color fills dominate

### Typography & Layout:
- Font family: Modern sans-serif (e.g., Inter, SF Pro, or similar)
- Font weights: Bold for headings, regular for body, medium for labels and card titles
- Hierarchy: Clear separation with larger, bold section headers, medium card titles, and light body text
- Spacing: Generous padding inside cards and list items (20–28px); consistent vertical rhythm
- Alignment: Left-aligned text and navigation; center-aligned elements for avatars and icons
- Typography treatments: All-caps for navigation sections, regular case for tasks and descriptions

### Key Design Elements

#### Card Design:
- Rounded corners (12–16px radius)
- Subtle, soft shadows for elevation
- No visible borders; separation through background contrast
- Hover state: Slightly lighter card shade, soft shadow intensification
- Visual hierarchy: Title at top, status/labels prominent, avatars and tags at bottom or side

#### Navigation:
- Persistent vertical sidebar, dark background, icons and text labels
- Active state: Accent color highlight (e.g., yellow or green bar/indicator)
- Collapsible sections: Chevron icons, smooth expand/collapse transitions
- Subdued inactive items, bold for selected/active

#### Data Visualization:
- Minimal data visualization; if present, simple linear progress bars (green/gray), pill-shaped and subtle
- Status tags: Rounded, filled with accent color, clear readable text
- No complex charts; focus on clarity and minimalism

#### Interactive Elements:
- Buttons: Rounded corners, medium fill (gray or accent); prominent primary actions
- Button hover: Slight color lift, soft shadow or subtle outline
- Form elements: Minimal, flat design; light border or fill for inputs
- Micro-interactions: Subtle icon shifts, soft background fade on hover

### Design Philosophy
This interface embodies:
- A modern, minimal, and professional aesthetic with a focus on clarity and efficiency
- Design principles: High contrast, generous spacing, clear hierarchy, and focused use of color for actionable and status-driven elements
- User experience goals: Reduce cognitive load, promote quick scanning, ensure ease of navigation, and build trust through a clean, organized, and visually calm environment

---" design pattern.
Ensure all implementations align with this pattern's best practices.

## Tech Stack Requirements

- **Framework:** React 18 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool:** Vite with SWC plugin
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS v3 with CSS custom properties
- **UI Components:** Shadcn/ui with Radix UI primitives
- **Animations:** Motion library (NOT framer-motion)
- **Icons:** Lucide React
- **State Management:** TanStack React Query
- **Forms:** React Hook Form with Zod validation
- **HTTP Client:** Axios
- **Notifications:** Sonner

## Critical Setup Rules

1. **ALWAYS run `npm install` before any build commands**
2. Use Motion library for animations, NOT framer-motion
3. Import Inter font in index.css
4. Use Tailwind v3 with tailwind.config.js (not CSS-based config)
5. Use `@/` path aliases for imports
6. Use Shadcn components instead of custom UI components

## Code Style

- Write concise, technical TypeScript code
- Use functional and declarative patterns (avoid classes)
- Favor iteration and modularization over duplication
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (isLoading, hasError)
- Structure: exported components, subcomponents, helpers, types
- Minimize `useEffect` and `useState`; favor React Server Components where possible

## API Layer Pattern

- Centralize API calls in `src/api/` directory
- Use Axios with interceptors for auth and error handling
- Create React Query hooks in `src/hooks/`
- Implement proper error handling with toast notifications
- Use TypeScript types for all API responses

# Modern Design Best Practices

## Philosophy

Create unique, memorable experiences while maintaining consistency through modern design principles. Every project should feel distinct yet professional, innovative yet intuitive.

---

## Landing Pages & Marketing Sites

### Hero Sections
**Go beyond static backgrounds:**
- Animated gradients with subtle movement
- Particle systems or geometric shapes floating
- Interactive canvas backgrounds (Three.js, WebGL)
- Video backgrounds with proper fallbacks
- Parallax scrolling effects
- Gradient mesh animations
- Morphing blob animations


### Layout Patterns
**Use modern grid systems:**
- Bento grids (asymmetric card layouts)
- Masonry layouts for varied content
- Feature sections with diagonal cuts or curves
- Overlapping elements with proper z-index
- Split-screen designs with scroll-triggered reveals

**Avoid:** Traditional 3-column equal grids

### Scroll Animations
**Engage users as they scroll:**
- Fade-in and slide-up animations for sections
- Scroll-triggered parallax effects
- Progress indicators for long pages
- Sticky elements that transform on scroll
- Horizontal scroll sections for portfolios
- Text reveal animations (word by word, letter by letter)
- Number counters animating into view

**Avoid:** Static pages with no scroll interaction

### Call-to-Action Areas
**Make CTAs impossible to miss:**
- Gradient buttons with hover effects
- Floating action buttons with micro-interactions
- Animated borders or glowing effects
- Scale/lift on hover
- Interactive elements that respond to mouse position
- Pulsing indicators for primary actions

---

## Dashboard Applications

### Layout Structure
**Always use collapsible side navigation:**
- Sidebar that can collapse to icons only
- Smooth transition animations between states
- Persistent navigation state (remember user preference)
- Mobile: drawer that slides in/out
- Desktop: sidebar with expand/collapse toggle
- Icons visible even when collapsed

**Structure:**
```
/dashboard (layout wrapper with sidebar)
  /dashboard/overview
  /dashboard/analytics
  /dashboard/settings
  /dashboard/users
  /dashboard/projects
```

All dashboard pages should be nested inside the dashboard layout, not separate routes.

### Data Tables
**Modern table design:**
- Sticky headers on scroll
- Row hover states with subtle elevation
- Sortable columns with clear indicators
- Pagination with items-per-page control
- Search/filter with instant feedback
- Selection checkboxes with bulk actions
- Responsive: cards on mobile, table on desktop
- Loading skeletons, not spinners
- Empty states with illustrations or helpful text

**Use modern table libraries:**
- TanStack Table (React Table v8)
- AG Grid for complex data
- Data Grid from MUI (if using MUI)

### Charts & Visualizations
**Use the latest charting libraries:**
- Recharts (for React, simple charts)
- Chart.js v4 (versatile, well-maintained)
- Apache ECharts (advanced, interactive)
- D3.js (custom, complex visualizations)
- Tremor (for dashboards, built on Recharts)

**Chart best practices:**
- Animated transitions when data changes
- Interactive tooltips with detailed info
- Responsive sizing
- Color scheme matching design system
- Legend placement that doesn't obstruct data
- Loading states while fetching data

### Dashboard Cards
**Metric cards should stand out:**
- Gradient backgrounds or colored accents
- Trend indicators (↑ ↓ with color coding)
- Sparkline charts for historical data
- Hover effects revealing more detail
- Icon representing the metric
- Comparison to previous period

---

## Color & Visual Design

### Color Palettes
**Create depth with gradients:**
- Primary gradient (not just solid primary color)
- Subtle background gradients
- Gradient text for headings
- Gradient borders on cards
- Elevated surfaces for depth

**Color usage:**
- 60-30-10 rule (dominant, secondary, accent)
- Consistent semantic colors (success, warning, error)
- Accessible contrast ratios (WCAG AA minimum)

### Typography
**Create hierarchy through contrast:**
- Large, bold headings (48-72px for heroes)
- Clear size differences between levels
- Variable font weights (300, 400, 600, 700)
- Letter spacing for small caps
- Line height 1.5-1.7 for body text
- Inter, Poppins, or DM Sans for modern feel

### Shadows & Depth
**Layer UI elements:**
- Multi-layer shadows for realistic depth
- Colored shadows matching element color
- Elevated states on hover
- Neumorphism for special elements (sparingly)

---

## Interactions & Micro-animations

### Button Interactions
**Every button should react:**
- Scale slightly on hover (1.02-1.05)
- Lift with shadow on hover
- Ripple effect on click
- Loading state with spinner or progress
- Disabled state clearly visible
- Success state with checkmark animation

### Card Interactions
**Make cards feel alive:**
- Lift on hover with increased shadow
- Subtle border glow on hover
- Tilt effect following mouse (3D transform)
- Smooth transitions (200-300ms)
- Click feedback for interactive cards

### Form Interactions
**Guide users through forms:**
- Input focus states with border color change
- Floating labels that animate up
- Real-time validation with inline messages
- Success checkmarks for valid inputs
- Error states with shake animation
- Password strength indicators
- Character count for text areas

### Page Transitions
**Smooth between views:**
- Fade + slide for page changes
- Skeleton loaders during data fetch
- Optimistic UI updates
- Stagger animations for lists
- Route transition animations

---

## Mobile Responsiveness

### Mobile-First Approach
**Design for mobile, enhance for desktop:**
- Touch targets minimum 44x44px
- Generous padding and spacing
- Sticky bottom navigation on mobile
- Collapsible sections for long content
- Swipeable cards and galleries
- Pull-to-refresh where appropriate

### Responsive Patterns
**Adapt layouts intelligently:**
- Hamburger menu → full nav bar
- Card grid → stack on mobile
- Sidebar → drawer
- Multi-column → single column
- Data tables → card list
- Hide/show elements based on viewport

---

## Loading & Empty States

### Loading States
**Never leave users wondering:**
- Skeleton screens matching content layout
- Progress bars for known durations
- Animated placeholders
- Spinners only for short waits (<3s)
- Stagger loading for multiple elements
- Shimmer effects on skeletons

### Empty States
**Make empty states helpful:**
- Illustrations or icons
- Helpful copy explaining why it's empty
- Clear CTA to add first item
- Examples or suggestions
- No "no data" text alone

---

## Unique Elements to Stand Out

### Distinctive Features
**Add personality:**
- Custom cursor effects on landing pages
- Animated page numbers or section indicators
- Unusual hover effects (magnification, distortion)
- Custom scrollbars
- Glassmorphism for overlays
- Animated SVG icons
- Typewriter effects for hero text
- Confetti or celebration animations for actions

### Interactive Elements
**Engage users:**
- Drag-and-drop interfaces
- Sliders and range controls
- Toggle switches with animations
- Progress steps with animations
- Expandable/collapsible sections
- Tabs with slide indicators
- Image comparison sliders
- Interactive demos or playgrounds

---

## Consistency Rules

### Maintain Consistency
**What should stay consistent:**
- Spacing scale (4px, 8px, 16px, 24px, 32px, 48px, 64px)
- Border radius values
- Animation timing (200ms, 300ms, 500ms)
- Color system (primary, secondary, accent, neutrals)
- Typography scale
- Icon style (outline vs filled)
- Button styles across the app
- Form element styles

### What Can Vary
**Project-specific customization:**
- Color palette (different colors, same system)
- Layout creativity (grids, asymmetry)
- Illustration style
- Animation personality
- Feature-specific interactions
- Hero section design
- Card styling variations
- Background patterns or textures
