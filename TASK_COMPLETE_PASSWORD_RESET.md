## User Flows Verified

### Flow 1: Request Password Reset ✅
1. User navigates to `/password-reset`
2. Enters email address
3. Clicks "Send Reset Link"
4. Sees success confirmation with CheckCircle icon
5. Can resend email after 60 seconds if needed
6. Returns to login or waits for email

### Flow 2: Reset Password ✅
1. User clicks link in email (with token)
2. Arrives at `/password-reset?token=xxx`
3. Enters new password (strength indicator updates in real-time)
4. Confirms new password
5. Clicks "Reset Password"
6. Sees success confirmation
7. Auto-redirected to login after 3 seconds

### Flow 3: Error Handling ✅
1. Invalid email format → Inline validation error
2. Weak password → Strength indicator shows "Weak" in red
3. Passwords don't match → Inline error on confirm field
4. Expired token → Toast error message
5. Network error → Toast error with option to retry
